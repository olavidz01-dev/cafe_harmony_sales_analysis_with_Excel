### Stock Performance
**Analysis & Insight:** 
Inventory analysis shows that 50% of stock items are below the recommended levels, indicating a potential risk to operations.

## Recommendations
### 1. Recalibrate Sales Targets & Incentives
**Why it matters:**

All sales employees significantly exceeded their targets, suggesting that the targets may be too conservative.

**Actions:** 
- Reset targets upward using recent performance baselines.
- Introduce tiered stretch incentives to sustain momentum.
- Protect morale by pairing higher targets with clearer upside rewards.

**Impact:** Higher revenue per employee without increasing headcount.


### 2. Fix Inventory  Imbalance to Reduce Revenue Leakage
**Why it matters:** 
50% of items are understocked while others are overstocked, tying up cash and risking stock-outs.

**Actions**
- Urgently restock high-risk understocked items.
- Reduce overstock on low-velocity items (e.g., Coffee Beans, Sugar).
- Implement minimum–maximum stock thresholds tied to sales velocity.

**Impact:** Improved product availability, reduced waste, and better cash flow.


### 3. Double Down on High-Performing Products
**Why it matters:** 
Muffin, Cappuccino, and Iced Tea are top revenue drivers, while others lag.

**Actions**
- Prioritize shelf space, promotions, and bundles around top sellers.
- Use underperforming products in cross-sell or discount strategies.
- Review pricing or positioning of consistently low performers.

**Impact:** Revenue growth without expanding product range.


### 4. Improve Customer Experience Consistency
**Why it matters:**
An average rating of 3.0 with polarized feedback indicates inconsistent experiences.

**Actions**
- Analyze 1–2 star feedback to identify root causes (service, quality, wait time).
- Standardize service processes across locations.
- Tie staff incentives partly to customer satisfaction scores.

**Impact:** Higher retention, stronger brand trust, and repeat purchases.


### 5. Leverage Gender Sales Insights for Targeted Marketing
**Why it matters:**
Female customers account for 54% of sales, representing a clear demand signal.

**Actions**
- Design targeted promotions, loyalty offers, or product bundles.
- Test messaging and product placement aligned to dominant segments.

**Impact:** Higher conversion and average order value.


### 6. Build a Performance-Driven Operating Model

**Why it matters:**
The dashboard shows strong execution but limited predictive control.

**Actions**
- Introduce forward-looking KPIs (sell-through rate, stock-out risk, satisfaction trend).
- Review dashboard monthly at the executive level with action ownership assigned.
- Transition from reporting to decision-driven analytics.

**Impact:** Faster decisions, scalable growth, and executive visibility.

## Executive Summary
The business is performing strongly, with sales consistently exceeding targets; however, growth is constrained by conservative target setting, inventory imbalances, uneven location performance, and inconsistent customer experience. 

Recalibrating sales targets and incentives, rebalancing inventory based on demand, prioritizing high-performing products and locations, and standardizing service quality will unlock higher revenue, improve margins, and reduce operational risk. 

Shifting from descriptive reporting to action-driven KPIs with clear ownership will enable scalable, data-led growth without increasing headcount.
